# Find-Cheapest-Store-Canada-MTG
Python script to find the cheapest store for a cards in a list. It returns the link to the store for each card with its cheapest price, including its set.
The stores included are ones I have bought from in the past and I personally know have great prices or ones that I know have most cards you would need in stock (ie. F2F and 401).
